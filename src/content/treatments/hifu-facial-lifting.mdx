faqs:
  - title: 'How do HIFU-Non-Surgical Treatments work?'
    description: "HIFU involves delivering focused ultrasound energy to targeted layers of the skin and underlying tissues. The treatment emits high-energy ultrasound waves at a swift 10Hz speed that accurately penetrates the skin surface without causing damage, targeting precise depths within the skin. By generating thermal and mechanical effects in the tissue, HIFU stimulates the body's natural healing response, triggering increased collagen production and tissue remodeling."
  - title: 'What areas of the face can be treated with HIFU Non-Surgical Lifting?'
    description: 'Optimised for versatility, Liftera brings the transformative results of HIFU to areas beyond the reach of traditional HIFU like the orbital ridge, tear trough, perinasal region and more.'
  - title: 'What results can I expect from HIFU Non-Surgical Lifting?'
    description: 'While some immediate skin tightening effects may be noticeable, the full benefits of HIFU typically become more apparent over the following weeks to months as collagen production continues.'
  - title: 'How long does the treatment take and what is the treatment downtime?'
    description: 'With the advancements of Liftera, it enables rapid, comfortable and precise treatments in as little as 30 minutes per session with noticeable enhancements after just one treatment. Liftera minimises swelling and redness side effects, allowing patients to resume normal activities immediately.'
