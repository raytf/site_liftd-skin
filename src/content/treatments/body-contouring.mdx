## The Science Behind Body Contouring

Our advanced ultrasound technology targets fat cells beneath the skin's surface. The focused energy disrupts the fat cell membranes, allowing the body to naturally eliminate the released fat through its lymphatic system.

## Treatment Process

1. **Assessment**: We evaluate your body composition and target areas.
2. **Mapping**: Treatment areas are mapped for precise energy delivery.
3. **Treatment**: Ultrasound energy is delivered to break down fat cells.
4. **Recovery**: The body naturally eliminates the treated fat cells.

## Expected Results

- Gradual reduction in fat deposits
- Improved body contour and shape
- Natural-looking results
- Long-lasting effects with proper maintenance

## Aftercare

- Stay hydrated to support lymphatic drainage
- Maintain a healthy diet
- Regular exercise as recommended
- Follow up with maintenance treatments as advised
