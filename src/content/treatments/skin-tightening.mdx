## Understanding RF Treatment

Radiofrequency (RF) treatment delivers controlled heat energy to the deeper layers of your skin. This thermal energy stimulates the production of new collagen and elastin, resulting in firmer, more youthful-looking skin.

## Treatment Process

1. **Consultation**: We assess your skin condition and treatment goals.
2. **Preparation**: Your skin is cleansed and prepared for the treatment.
3. **Treatment**: RF energy is delivered to target areas.
4. **Cooling**: The treated area is cooled for comfort.
