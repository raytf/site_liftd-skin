## How HIFU Works

HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound) is a non-invasive treatment that uses focused ultrasound energy to target deep tissue layers. The energy creates controlled thermal injury points that trigger the body's natural healing response, leading to new collagen production and skin tightening.

## Treatment Process

1. **Consultation**: We begin with a thorough assessment of your skin condition and treatment goals.
2. **Preparation**: Your skin is cleansed and prepared for the treatment.
3. **Treatment**: The HIFU device delivers focused ultrasound energy to targeted areas.
4. **Recovery**: Most patients can resume normal activities immediately.

## Expected Results

- Gradual improvement in skin tightness and firmness
- Natural-looking results that develop over 2-3 months
- Long-lasting effects with proper maintenance

## Aftercare

- Avoid sun exposure for 48 hours
- Use recommended skincare products
- Stay hydrated
- Follow up with maintenance treatments as advised
